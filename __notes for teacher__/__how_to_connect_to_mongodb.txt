The main database is based on a non-relationship db like mongodb

> To connect/manage it:
    Step 1: Visit https://account.mongodb.com/account/login
    Step 2: Login with email address "alemihai25@gmail.com" password "MyDBpassMihai123"


> Hotel Admin Email login:            <- to be able see all the features
    https://qualityhotel.herokuapp.com/users/login
    user: admin@qualityhotel.co.uk
    pass: admin@qualityhotel.co.uk

as for a customer account, please create & use a real email to receive all the confirmations :) fun fun

> For Database Access (that i use from nodeJS) i have created a separate user to connect with:
    username: alemihai25@gmail.com
    pass: MyDBpassMihai123
