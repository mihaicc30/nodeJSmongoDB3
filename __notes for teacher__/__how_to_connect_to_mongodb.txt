Hi! This is a guide on how to connect remotely to my database.

The main database is based on a non-relationship db like mongodb

To connect/manage it:

Step 1: Visit https://account.mongodb.com/account/login
Step 2: Login with email address "alemihai25@gmail.com" password "MyDBpassMihai123"


Hotel Admin Email login:            <- to be able see all the features
https://qualityhotel.herokuapp.com/users/login
user: admin@qualityhotel.co.uk
pass: admin@qualityhotel.co.uk

as for a customer account, please create & use a real email to receive all the confirmations :) fun fun

For Database Access (that i use from nodeJS) i have created a separate user to connect with:
username: mihaiapp
pass: MyDBpassMihai123
