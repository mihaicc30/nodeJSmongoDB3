Hi! in case you are seeing this...

- you either hacked my pc
- you are working for my uni at solent
- or you are me?! wait hmm....

Anyways have fun!

My name is Mihai Culea, student at Solent Uni and i hope you wil like what you see.

To easily start the node server, please use the *bat file (its just a terminal command with 'nodemon app.js') and proceed on http://localhost:8080/

Otherwise find your own way :D good luck
Kind regards
