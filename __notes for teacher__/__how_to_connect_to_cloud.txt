Hi! This is a guide on how to connect remotely to my database.

The main database is based on a non-relationship db like mongodb

To connect/manage it:

Step 1: Visit https://account.mongodb.com/account/login
Step 2: Login with email address "alemihai25@gmail.com" password "MyDBpassMihai123"



For Database Access (that i use from nodeJS) i have created a separate user to connect with:
username: mihaiapp
pass: MyDBpassMihai123
